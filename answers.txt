A *merge* combines two different branches of a repository. This can be a local versus remote repository, or merging two different branches. 

A *rebase* rewrites the history of a branch by updating the apparent start of a branch to a different commit. This can be used to change or erase revision history. 
For example, two merged branches could be rebased so it looks like `branchA` and `branchB`'s work happened sequentially, where they were actually developed independently and then 
merged together.
